To bake toast, preheat your oven to 350°F-400°F (\(175^{\circ }\text{C}-200^{\circ }\text{C}\)) and place slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, or directly on the oven rack. Bake for 4-10 minutes, flipping halfway through, until golden brown and crispy. Oven Toasting Methods Standard Bake (Best for crispy toast): Preheat oven to 350°F-400°F. Place bread on a baking sheet (ungreased) in a single layer. Bake for 4-6 minutes, flip, and bake for another 4-5 minutes.Direct Rack Method (Fastest): Preheat oven to 350°F. Place slices directly on the center oven rack. Check after 2-3 minutes, flip, and continue toasting to desired darkness.Broiler Method (Quickest, but highest burn risk): Move oven rack to the top position and set broiler to high. Place bread on a sheet pan, broil for 1-2 minutes, flip, and broil for another 30-60 seconds, watching constantly to avoid burning. Tips for Success No Grease: Do not butter or grease the baking sheet; it can make the toast soggy.Watch Closely: Ovens vary, and bread can turn from toasted to burned quickly, especially under the broiler.Toppings: Remove from the oven and apply butter or toppings immediately while hot.
